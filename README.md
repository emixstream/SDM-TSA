Streaming Data Management and Time Series Analysis is a course based firstly on the application of Arima plus derivative models and UCM model to study historical data (time series) like seasonality decomposition and such and make forecasts.

The second part of the course is instead based on neural models such as LSTM and GRU (RNN) to perform the same tasks, especially forecasting.

In this repo that is my project, I ranked among the top 5 in the final ranking (challenge among course colleagues)
